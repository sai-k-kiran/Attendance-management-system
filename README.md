# Attendance management system
 
 This website can be used to record the attendance of students in different lectures and can be referred to later just like an old style diary/book in which you can log the attendance
 of your students including the lecture name and the date when it was conducted.
 
 The website is created using django as backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It has a simple colour scheme and a minimal UI.
 
 # Features
 
 - Add a new lecture
